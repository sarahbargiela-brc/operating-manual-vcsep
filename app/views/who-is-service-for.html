      <p class="govuk-body">This service is for grassroots, voluntary and community groups, and other local organisations in England.</p>
      <p>Many groups in the UK are already providing outstanding support to their communities, especially during COVID-19.  When local organisations need extra support they can also approach:</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use the VCS EP service</h2>

  <p>There are times when there is no local capacity to provide the support required. When that happens, local organisations can make a request for support from the new ‘Request support as a voluntary or community organisation’ service.
  </p>
  <p>Requests are reviewed by local liaison leads, who find help locally or escalate to a regional panel of voluntary and community groups.</p>
