      <p> Information managers contact the organisation requesting support <strong>within 24 hours</strong> of having received their request through the ‘Request support as a voluntary and community organisation’ service.</p>
      <p>
        If the request has been made by a liaison lead, they will also receive an email within 24 hours, detailing the request for support they have made for the local organisation.<p>
      <p>This does not mean arrangements for support are made in 24 hours. It is a first contact timeframe for information managers to acknowledge the request for support.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Urgent requests</h1>
      <p>If a request is urgent, 5 regional teams each have a duty manager available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Find out how to access duty manager details in the <a href="/useful-contacts">useful contacts section</a>.</p>
